	<!-- 
	Well done for getting this far - this tutorial includes all the tasks from the previous session to help you check your work and give you a common starting point for the next set of tasks.

	During this tutorial we will still be focusing on programming the canvas and stylus bits.  Although you will be given some code you are strongly encouraged to review and research its use online. 
	Search "html5 canvas" or take a look at:
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial

	General Changes:
		Created a paint stylus function called fnPaintStylus and added calls to ensure it is executed every time a button is pressed.
		Added the new function to the fnInitialise instructions so that the stylus appears immediately. 
		Added a clear button.

	We have introduced some new things:
		1. fillStyle, the fillStyle property sets or returns the colour, gradient or pattern used to fill the drawing.
			for more information on this please search online or take a look at:
			https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_fillstyle.asp

		2. fillRect, this method (function) draws a "filled" rectangle, the default colour of the fill is black (unless changed var fillStyle).
			for more information on this please search online or take a look at:
			https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_fillrect.asp

		3. clearRect, this method (function) clears the specified pixels within a given rectangle.

	An important note and something to think about:
		You will need to have the console window open to see any messages being issued by the fnShowState function.
		Up and Left should decrease the appropriate positional values (as highlighted in tutorial 2)
		Down and Right should increase the appropriate positional values (as highlighted in tutorial 2)



	Tasks:
		1. Spend some time reviewing and identifying the fixes against your version - try to make sure you understand the issues causing the problems.
		2. Get this program running in Chrome and test it; after you make any changes - save and test your code to confirm it works.
		3. Review the new functions.
		4. Use the two oCanvas.width, oCanvas.height properties to automatically set the stylus starting position to the centre of the canvas.
		5. Update the clear function so that after it resets the canvas it repaints the stylus at the starting position.
		6. Add the facility for the user to select different sizes for the stylus.
		7. Add the ability to change the colour of the stylus.
		8. Try to REFACTOR your code to remove any unnecessary duplication; in essence, refactoring is the restructuring of your code to reduce needless repetition and improve its efficiency without changing its operation or required behaviour.

				//element with the specified ID; in this case it will find the canvas element.
				//the ID provided must match the element ID used for the canvas otherwise the following instructions will 
				//not work (because the dependent information would be found, due to not being able to find the canvas).

				if (oCanvas.getContext) { //if we can get the canvas' context execute the following
					oCanvasContext = oCanvas.getContext("2d"); //set the context to 2D, that way we are dealing with X and Y positions

					//initialise both the variables used to hold the X and Y position of the stylus to 0
					iXPos=0;

				oCanvasContext.fillStyle = "#ff0000";
				oCanvasContext.fillRect(iXPos, iYPos, 5, 5); //fillRect() method (function) draws a "filled" rectangle; default color black.
			}

			function fnShowState() {
				//this function will be used to help us see whats happening live in our program 
				//it will use a built-in JavaScript function called "console.log" to show us the state of our program while we test it
				console.log("Stylus X Position: " + iXPos + ", Y Position: " + iYPos); //this will use the same window we use to debug errors but now it will also show us the values being held by both the iXPos and iYPos variables

				//this function will be executed when the user clicks the UP button
				iYPos = iYPos - 5; //reduce the Y position for the stylus

			function fnRight() {

				fnPaintStylus(); //paint the stylus at the new location
				//1. takes the value currently stored in the variable iXPos and adds 5 to it 
				//2. stores the new value back in the variable iXPos
				//in general, this updates the value of the variable by the number specified (in this instance, 5)
