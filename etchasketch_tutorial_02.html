	Well done for getting this far - this tutorial includes all the tasks from the previous session to help you check your work and give you a common starting point for the next set of tasks.

	During this tutorial we will be focusing on programming the canvas and stylus bits.  Although you will be given some code you are strongly encouraged to review and research its use online. 
	Search "html5 canvas" or take a look at:
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial

	We have introduced some new things:
		we have added "onload" to the body tag and set it to fnInitialise() - in essence, this tells the browser to call (execute) 
		the function "fnInitialise" as soon as the page has loaded; this means that this function is the first function that is 
		called - we can use this 'feature' to setup or initialise anything we need/want (in this session, will be using it to setup the 
		canvas and initialise the stylus). 

	An important note and something to think about:
		A browser will run any JavaScript instructions immediately that aren't inside a function.
		Instructions inside a function are only executed when the function is "called".
		The 2D Canvas works on an X and Y axis, X is horizontal (left/right) and Y is vertical (up/down).
		Higher X numbers are further from the left.
		Higher Y numbers are further from the top.  



	Tasks:
		1. Spend some time reviewing the comments and code - try to work out what things should be happening and when 
		2. Oh no, there are a few errors already on this page - you will need to debug and fix them, hint:
			there are primarily 3 errors, one error is causing a knock-on effect (which is the second error) and the third will likely not be detected until the first 2 are fixed; take your time - this is good practice!!!
			The first is also causing errors if the user clicks any of the buttons (this is again a knock-on effect of the first error)
		3. Get this program running in Chrome and test it; after you make any changes - save and test your code to confirm it works

		Well done, once you have successfully programmed and tested each task move on to the next tutorial

				//not work (because the dependent information would be found, due to not being able to find the canvas).

					oCanvasContext = oCanvas.getContext("2d"); //set the context to 2D, that way we are dealing with X and Y positions
					alert("Canvas has been set to 2D"); //execute the JavaScript alert function, pass it a string (alphanumeric characters)
